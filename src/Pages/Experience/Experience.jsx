        "During my role as a Full Stack Developer at HypeScout Pte. Ltd., I worked on building and optimizing server-rendered web applications using React.js and Node.js, with a focus on performance and scalability. I developed RESTful APIs with Python FastAPI to enable efficient communication between the frontend and backend, and I integrated OpenAI NLP models to create a chatbot that automated user queries, reducing the need for manual intervention and enhancing user engagement. In addition, I designed a global state management store to support the applicationâ€™s complex data needs, collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to deliver user-friendly solutions, and applied testing frameworks to ensure the robustness of speech- and language-driven applications.",

          As a Research Assistant, I designed and implemented a data
          preprocessing and visualization pipeline to handle large-scale
          industrial datasets, enabling cleaner and more insightful analysis. My
          work involved applying machine learning algorithms for anomaly
          detection, which improved the reliability and accuracy of data-driven
          insights. This research led to a peer-reviewed IEEE publication
          (2021), which I co-authored, available{" "}
